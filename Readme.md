# Movie Trailer Website
Welcome to my first Udacity project for the Full Stack Program. A program that will display website of my favorite movies. 

**Install**
* To run the program you will first need to install python
* Go to the [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) website and download Python 2.7.13 for your computer. 

**Runing the program**
* Once you've installed Python onto your computer open the `EntertainmentCenter.py`file.
* Once the program opens you can either press fn+f5 (if running MacOS) or select Run on the task bar as and then Run Moduel on either a Mac or Windows OS.

### Have fun
I enjoyed making this project and hope you enjoy what I've put together.
